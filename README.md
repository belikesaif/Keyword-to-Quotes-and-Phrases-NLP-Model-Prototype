# Keyword-to-Quotes-and-Phrases-NLP-Model-Prototype
This repository contains a prototype for a Keyword to Quotes and Phrases Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. The goal of this project is to associate quotes and phrases with specific keywords using a simple machine learning approach.

# Usage
## Environment Setup:

Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).
Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Running the Code:

Run the provided Python script keyword_to_quotes_nlp.py.
Modify the keyword variable in the script to use your desired keyword or phrase.
Code Description
keyword_to_quotes_nlp.py:
Defines the sample dataset with keywords mapped to associated quotes.
Prepares the data for machine learning, splits it into training and testing sets.
Creates a machine learning model using TF-IDF vectorization and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
Implements a function to predict quotes based on keywords or input phrases.
Performance
The performance of this prototype is evaluated based on the simplicity of the approach and the accuracy in predicting quotes or associating phrases with keywords. This is a basic demonstration and not intended to be a fully-fledged NLP model.

# Accuracy:

For known keywords, the model successfully predicts associated quotes.
For unknown keywords, the model attempts to predict quotes based on input phrases.
Limitations:

The dataset and model are limited for a prototype and do not cover a wide range of keywords and phrases.
The model is a basic demonstration and does not utilize advanced NLP techniques.
Future Improvements
Enhance the dataset with a more diverse set of quotes and phrases for different keywords.
Implement more sophisticated NLP techniques and models to improve accuracy and robustness.
Explore fine-tuning options for better model performance.
